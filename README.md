# Deep Active Inference

This is a work I did in my early Ph.D. years 2020-2021 at UC San Diego Computer Music with Prof. Shlomo Dubnov. We investigated the artificial interactive systems under active inference and the free energy principle to understand how individuals or musicians infer each others' minds and adapt behaviors accordingly in a communicative or collective context. This work was presented at Prof. Karl Friston's Theoretical Neurobiology Seminar at University College London on June 10th, 2021 [[presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W5Op0P_I2fS078E3L6AGVdwaEGdfBgca/view?usp=drive_link)].

- **Deep neural network implementation of active inference**: By coupling two LSTM attention neural networks as the perception-action cycle indicates, we simulate the inference-action process between the agent and environment under the free energy principle (the environment is treated as another agent with the same inference ability).
    
- **Variational niche construction via a way of ''[thinking through other minds](https://sandervandecruys.be/pdf/2020_VandeCruysHeylighenBBS_Dark_side.pdf)''**: By generalizing the vanilla agent-environment model, we proposed a linguistic communication model that positions the agent and environment at equal status, thus constructing the niche interactively by active inference.

- **Real-time synchronization \& collective improvisation**: A music model that favors the active niche construction but achieves real-time synchronization is established, which addresses the ''collective improvisation'' problem widely studied in music performance especially free jazz.
